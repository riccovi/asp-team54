# Installation guide
## Terminal:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev

PixelPulse runs on port 3000!

## P5JS Instance Mode
The transformation from a simple p5.js sketch into instance mode involves encapsulating your existing p5.js code into a JavaScript function that accepts an instance of p5.js (p) as an argument. You then refer to the p5.js instance (p) whenever you want to call p5.js functions or access p5.js variables.

When copying your p5.js code, you must surround your code with "let s = (p) => {}", and call every p5.js function with the prefix "p"; 'p.setup = function(){}' as an example. We recommend you copy and paste your code and not type it directly into the submission.
